# WPSEA Meetup Events To Posts

Creates WordPress posts from Meetup.com events

## TODO
* Complete custom post type meta fields
* Complete importing events from Meetup API
* Complete the shortcode to display the posts
* Add installation documentation
* Make posts read-only? Otherwise any changes they make will be overridden when the event is updated on meetup.com
	* Could add an option to set a 'dont update' flag on the post
